      <p>When Jack and Euan from Pride Trade Services approached me, they were looking for a complete redesign of their brand, to showcase their high-quality joinery, plumbing, and tiling services.</p>

<p>Based in Edinburgh, they had a solid reputation for delivering exceptional bathroom and kitchen renovations, but their existing website and branding didn&rsquo;t do justice to their craftsmanship or their client-centric approach.</p>
<h3 id="the-initial-consultation">The Initial Consultation</h3>
<p>During our initial consultation, it was clear that Jack and Euan wanted a website that not only highlighted their portfolio but also conveyed their dedication to quality and customer satisfaction. They shared their desire for a sleek, modern design that would appeal to homeowners looking for premium renovation services. They also needed a platform that would allow potential clients to easily request consultations and view detailed examples of their work.</p>
<h3 id="crafting-the-perfect-solution">Crafting the Perfect Solution</h3>
<p><strong>1. Website Design and Development</strong></p>
<p>I started by designing a clean, user-friendly website that emphasised Wilkie &amp; Gillan&rsquo;s strengths. The homepage features a welcoming introduction to their services and a compelling call-to-action for consultations. High-quality images of their recent projects were essential to visually demonstrate their expertise, so I created a dynamic portfolio section showcasing their best work.</p>
<p><strong>2. Branding and Logo Design</strong></p>
<p>Wilkie &amp; Gillan needed a brand identity that reflected their professionalism and attention to detail. I designed a new logo that embodied the elegance and precision of their work, ensuring it was versatile for both digital and print use.</p>
<p><strong>3. Copywriting</strong></p>
<p>To resonate with potential clients, the website copy needed to be warm, friendly, and professional. I crafted content that highlighted Jack and Euan&rsquo;s dedication to client satisfaction, their meticulous approach to each project, and their extensive experience. Testimonials from satisfied clients were prominently featured to build trust and credibility.</p>
<p><strong>4. Business Email Setup</strong></p>
<p>A professional email setup was crucial for their business communications. I created custom email addresses that aligned with their domain, ensuring they had a polished and cohesive digital presence.</p>
<h3 id="the-results">The Results</h3>
<p>The new Wilkie &amp; Gillan website has been a game-changer for their business. The modern design and intuitive navigation have made it easier for clients to explore their services and get inspired by their past projects. The website&rsquo;s consultation request form has streamlined their client intake process, resulting in more qualified leads and better project planning.</p>
<p>Jack and Euan have received numerous compliments on the new site, and their enhanced online presence has led to a noticeable increase in client inquiries. The branding and professional email setup have further solidified their reputation as top-tier renovation experts in Edinburgh.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Working with Wilkie &amp; Gillan was a rewarding experience. Seeing their business grow and thrive with a polished, professional website has been incredibly satisfying. Jack and Euan&rsquo;s commitment to excellence and client satisfaction is truly inspiring, and I&rsquo;m honoured to have played a part in their success.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to elevate your business&rsquo;s digital presence, I&rsquo;m here to help. Whether it&rsquo;s designing a stunning website, crafting compelling copy, or creating a cohesive brand identity, let&rsquo;s work together to bring your vision to life.</p>
